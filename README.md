# [Convex Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) Simulation
An interactive simulation allowing users to see Jarvis March and Kirkpatrick Seidel in action. Users can control simulation speed and the number of points dynamically. The simulation is hosted [here](https://saphereye.github.io/Convex-Hull-CS-F364/).
