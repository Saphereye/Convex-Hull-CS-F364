# [Convex Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) Simulation

## Prereqs
- Install [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Learn](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) Rust (Optional)
- Go through [bevy examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#examples)

## How to run
- Install [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) using `cargo install --locked trunk` or if you are feeling fancy
```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/releases/download/0.17.10/trunk-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xzf-
``` 
- Run `trunk serve`. This will first compile the program (which will take a lot of time at first)
- After that's complete the application will be hosted on `127.0.0.1:8080`

## Additional comments
- I have added the ithub pages integration so the application will be hosted on github directly now
